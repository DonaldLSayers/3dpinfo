# Welcome to 3DP INFO

I'm trying to build a repository of useful info for 3D printing.
Everything is free to share and feel free to help make contributions.

## To-Do

* `Filament Guide` - Types of filament and what to use it for. General print settings and manufacture suggestions. 
* `Vendor Recommendations` - Links to people we trust vetting will take place with all vendor before being added.
* `Printer Recommendations` - Strict requirements on manufactures being open and having a good track record.
* `Tuning Guide` - *[We just recommend checking out Ellis](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/)*.
